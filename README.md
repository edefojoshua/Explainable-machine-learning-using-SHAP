This project used explainable machine learning, specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to identify and interpret key predictors of an individual’s cardiovascular health status. The workflow began with data exploration, using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to load and inspect a dataset of records containing demographic, clinical, and behavioural variables. After confirming that no missing data were present, feature engineering defined all predictors except the target variable healthy, and the dataset was split into training and test sets.

Two classification models—Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—were trained and evaluated, with Gradient Boosting showing superior accuracy. SHAP was applied through a TreeExplainer to interpret individual predictions and quantify each feature’s contribution. Results showed cholesterol as the strongest positive predictor, followed by maximum heart rate, resting blood pressure, and age. This workflow demonstrates a transparent machine-learning pipeline that improves interpretability and supports health-related decision-making.
