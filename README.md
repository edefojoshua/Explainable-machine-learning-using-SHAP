This project uses explainable machine learning, specifically SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), to identify and interpret key predictors of cardiovascular health status of an individual. The workflow begins with data exploration, using Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to load and inspect a dataset of 297 records containing demographic, clinical, and behavioural variables. After confirming that no missing data are present, feature engineering defines all predictors except the target variable healthy, and the dataset is split into training and test sets.
Two classification models—Random Forest and Gradient Boosting—are trained and evaluated, with Gradient Boosting showing superior accuracy. SHAP is then applied through a TreeExplainer to interpret individual predictions and quantify each feature’s contribution. Results show cholesterol as the strongest positive predictor, followed by maximum heart rate, resting blood pressure, and age. This workflow demonstrates a transparent machine-learning pipeline that improves interpretability and supports health-related decision-making.
